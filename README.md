pyspark_sql_on_Airline data
Using analysis of airline data, we can determine what factors contribute to flight delays and cancellations.
Pyspark data exploration using pysparksql as an impostor.
The flights' velocities have been calculated.


step 1: creating a sparksession by installing pyspark 
step 2: creating spark object.
step 3: creating a dataframe importing the airline dataset.
step 4: creating temp table for the dataframe
step 5: Perfoming sql operations calcuating average departure in the delay, overall flights delay,total number of flights from the origin, orgin wise flights delay, cancellation, diverted, on time arrival.
step 6: To calculate the flight perfromance yearly by creating 4 different data frames, also calculating the percentage of the flights on time, delayed and diverted.
step 7: Ranking the flights from the origin, total air time, distance travelled.
step 8: Calculating the speed of flights per hour.
